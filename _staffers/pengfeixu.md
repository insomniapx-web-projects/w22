Hey there! Welcome to CSW 8!
My name is Pengfei Xu, a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science department. I got my Master's Degree at Rice University. I worked as a machine learning researcher at Ford and Katana Graph. I enjoyed learning facinating topics in computer science like programming languages, compilers and operating systems. Hope you guys can see how charming coding is by starting with some hands-on experience in this course.

In my spare time, I love to play ball games and video games. I am also a meat-lover, a traveller and a MJ fan. Looking forward to meet you all in the winter quarter!
