## Welcome to CMPSCW 8: Introduction to Computer Science at UCSB! 

The link to this webpage is [{{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}).

## Getting Started

_Before the first day of class_

- Subscribe to the e-textbook ([zybooks](https://zybooks.com)) following the instructions posted on the Main tab on Gauchospace.
    - This interactive online textbook is required and the subscription must be purchased _individually_. A large portion of your course grade will depend on the activities that you will complete and submit in this zyBook (pronounced as zEYE-book).
    - After subscribing, we recommend that you go to <https://learn.zybooks.com/library> and read through the “How to Use zyBooks” book.
- Read the [course syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about)
- Read the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq). Note any questions that you still have - submit them through the Welcome Survey. 
- Read [How to Succeed in CSW 8]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success)
- Add the [weekly pattern/deadlines to your calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success/#roadmap)
- Fill out the **Welcome Survey** linked on Gauchospace.

_Next steps_
- Start reading Chapters 1 and 2 on zyBooks
- Attend the syncronous class
- You will be added to the course forum (Piazza) and the Gradescope site on Tuesday evening, after the first lecture, once we close the waitlist. In the meantime, you can use the form that's linked on the course website to submit any questions that you have.
